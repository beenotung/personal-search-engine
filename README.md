### Example Queries

When searching with "`react + typescript - redux`", it will search for websites that include "react" and "typescript" but excluding those including "redux".

When searching with "`css module + (angular,react)`", it will treat "css module" as a single term. This query can be used when you want to find websites covering how to apply css module in (angular or react) application.
The spaces between operators are optional.

One more example, when search with "`typescript-google search`", it will search for websites that mention typescript but excluding google search result pages.

**Remark**: The search terms are case-insensitive
